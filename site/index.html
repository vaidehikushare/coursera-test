	<h1>Our Menu</h1>

<div id= "box1">
	<div class="t">Chicken</div>
	<p>Start with fresh boneless skinless chicken thighs. Boneless skinless chicken breasts would also work with this recipe!
Combine all the seasonings in a small bowl and sprinkle on both sides of the chicken.
You can cook the chicken on a grill pan, over a traditional grill or even in your oven!
This chicken is ready in about 15 to 20 minutes!</p>
</div>

<div id = "box2">
	<div class ="t">Sushi</div>
	<p>Place your desired ingredients onto the rice. I’ve got salmon, avocado, and cream cheese.Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat. Then use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into pieces. Now you’re ready to eat the rolls with some soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi, as desired!</p>
</div>

<div id = "box3">
	<div class ="t">Beef</div>
<p>Heat olive oil  in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, 5 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Add onion garlic to the skillet; cook until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir until all of the browned bits have mixed in with the liquid. Pour in the beef stock, cover and simmer over low heat until very tender, about 2 hours.</p>
